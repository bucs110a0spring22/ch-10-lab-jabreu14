## SUMMARY:
In this program, a 'hero' is able to 'fight' various enemies by walking towards them. My program allows the enemies to move randomly by either -1, 0, or 1 in the x and y direction.
#### Unique Feature
 The unique feature I added allows the enemies and the hero to appear on the opposite side of the screen if they go out of bounds. For example, if the hero or the enemies goes out of bounds on the right side of the screen, they will appear on the left side. This also applies to the top and bottom of the screen.
